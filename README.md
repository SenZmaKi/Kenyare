# Problem Description

The current process of handling Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) quotation requests is largely manual, involving the analysis of proposal forms and associated documents. This approach is time-consuming and labor-intensive, resulting in significant delays in the submission of quotes to our business partners. Presently, we rely on an Excel template for data entry and quote generation, which not only increases the likelihood of errors but also hampers efficiency and responsiveness.

As the insurance industry evolves and the demand for timely and accurate quotes grows, our manual processes are becoming a bottleneck. The inability to quickly analyze and process requests undermines our operational effectiveness and customer satisfaction. To maintain our competitive edge and ensure optimal service delivery, there is an urgent need to automate the reinsurance underwriting quotation process. This transition aims to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and overall value for our business partners, ultimately driving better outcomes for all stakeholders involved.

# Proposed solution

he proposed solution is an AI-powered bot designed to automate the processing of Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) quotation requests. This bot will autonomously handle the majority of the process, minimizing the need for manual input and significantly reducing time delays.
